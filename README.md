## What It Is

The Soil Classification App is an innovative tool designed to assist farmers, gardeners, and agricultural enthusiasts in identifying soil types using just an image. By leveraging machine learning with TensorFlow Lite, the app analyzes soil images and classifies them into specific types, offering tailored crop recommendations based on the soil type.

This app was developed as a group project for **Bitcamp**, a hackathon where we collaborated to bring this idea to life.

## The Problem It Solves

üåç **Soil variability** is a significant challenge in agriculture, impacting crop yield and sustainability. Understanding the soil type is crucial for making informed decisions about which crops to plant. However, soil testing can be costly and time-consuming, making it inaccessible to many, especially in remote areas.

This app democratizes soil analysis, making it **accessible and easy** for anyone with a smartphone to identify their soil type and make informed agricultural decisions.

## Real-World Applications

- **Farmers:** Easily determine the best crops to plant based on soil type, maximizing yield and sustainability.
- **Gardeners:** Optimize your garden by choosing plants that thrive in your specific soil conditions.
- **Agricultural Researchers:** Quickly classify soil samples during fieldwork.
- **Environmentalists:** Monitor soil health and make recommendations for soil conservation efforts.

## Usage

1. **Upload an Image:** Take a picture of the soil or upload an existing image.
   
2. **Run Classification:** The app processes the image using TensorFlow Lite to classify the soil type.

3. **View Results:** Receive detailed information about the soil type, including characteristics and properties.

4. **Get Crop Recommendations:** Based on the classified soil type, the app suggests the most suitable crops to grow.
